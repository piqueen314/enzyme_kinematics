### BioChemProjMMCurves.ipynb ###
This note book shows how to load data into a structure of R vectors. Use the Dose Responce Model to build a 
Michaelis Menten model with substrate concentration and V naught vectors. How to use the R library nls to do a non linear least squares fit.

### lineweaverBurk.ipynb ###
This notebook shows how we can load product concentration and v naughts in to R vectors and then use the R language's built in plot command to plot raw data and a linear regression fit. 

### ExampleFitAnalysis.ipynb ###
This shows how removing a point can make a better non linear least squares fit, but maybe doesn't give you at better answer.
